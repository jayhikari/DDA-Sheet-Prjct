# DDA-Sheet-Prjct
Roll20 Sheet Design for DDA System

This sheet is far from done, but as is, should be suitable for use. This project/repository is subject to change at any time.

Thank you for trying out my sheet, and I thank you for your patience and input in getting this sheet to work at its full potential!

---*NOTES*---

1)The Sheet itself has been made for PC use, and does not work properly on phone. I will work to figure that issue out after the sheet is done for pc.

2)Torments have no background as I'm trying to figure out how to make it so that the background repeats when a new Torment is added.

3)The "Digimon" sheets have been left completely blank, using regular HTML for organization. I need to make the background images then I will organize them in the same manor as the "Tamer" Sheet
