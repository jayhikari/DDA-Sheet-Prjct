# DDA-Sheet-Prjct
Roll20 Sheet Design for DDA System

This sheet is far from done, but as is, should be suitable for use. This project/repository is subject to change at any time.
As of Apr 5th, the "Tamer" Section is considered "Complete", however if there are any bugs/Ease of Life ("EoL") changes made, they will be noted.
Thank you for trying out my sheet, and I thank you for your patience and input in getting this sheet to work at its full potential!

---*NOTES*---

1)The Sheet itself has been made for PC use, and does not work properly on phone. I will work to figure that issue out after the sheet is done for pc.

2)The "Digimon" sheets have been left completely blank, using regular HTML for organization. I need to make the background images then I will organize them in the same manor as the "Tamer" Sheet
