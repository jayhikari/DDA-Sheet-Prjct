# DDA-Sheet-Prjct
Roll20 Sheet Design for DDA System

This sheet is far from done, but as is, should be suitable for use. This project/repository is subject to change at any time.

Thank you for trying out my sheet, and I thank you for your patience and input in getting this sheet to work at its full potential!

---*NOTES*---

1)"Derived stats" background image needs to be modified for labels of what each number is, so until then this is the layout:
  Creation Points:
    Starting Value (from age) | Total Accumulated | Extra used (i.e. from paying for Torment boxes at creation etc.) | Total Used
    
  Movement:
    Movement Modifier | Movement Total
  
  Health:
    Modifier | Total | Current
  
  Armor, Accuracy, Damage and Dodge:
    Modifier | Total
    
  Inspiration and Sanity:
    Current | Maximum
  
2)On looking back, I need to add a "Roll" section for derived stats (Accuracy, Damage and Dodge).

3)"Aspects" have no definition of the numbers for the "Uses" section. Will work on the background image design for that. Until then,
  Top number (NONchangeable) = Number of Uses Total
  Bottom num (CHANGEABLE) = Number of Uses Exhausted

4)Torments have no background as I'm trying to figure out how to make it so that the background repeats when a new Torment is added.
